### Added
- FAQs page for common issues and solutions
- section for citations and license in about page

### Changed

- adjusted `write_diagram` graph flipping for repaired orientations
- updated default arrow position calculation on `Connector` dataclass to reflect repaired orientations
- repository location. The CEMENTO repository is now "owned" by the CWRU-SDLE organization
- base URL for documentation. It is now in [https://cwru-sdle.github.io/CEMENTO/](https://cwru-sdle.github.io/CEMENTO/)

### Fixed

- term location not printing on diagram error causing error
- reversed arrow configuration on `connector.xml` template
- missing parent content for `missingChildError`

## [0.8.8] - 2025-07-25

### Added

- more detailed key error message for `generate_graph`
- null safety checks after diagram error detection in `diagram_terms_iter`

- default terms in `drawio_to_ttl` to use all default terms in rdflib and in default file folders
- print out triples that passed diagram checks but caught in null check in `convert_graph_to_ttl`
- replaced all ghost connectors with straight orthogonal connectors

### Fixed

- fixed class and instance designation in graph_to_tll

### Removed

removed root IDs from extracted terms and relationships in extract_elements

### Added

- error check option on CLI
- term content in diagram error message
- defaults folder file contents to search terms
- feature to remove redundant statements about default namespace terms
- ability to define object properties
- support for multipage inputs
- feature to replace default object-property assignment to custom properties to swap with definitions if available

### Changed

- `file_path` argument in `conver_drawio_ttl` function to `input_path`

### Removed

- hand-made XSD reference
- do not check option
- not literal IDs

### Fixed

- exact match functionality not outputting all desired properties (label and SKOS exact match)
- non-bunny-eared data type string output
- prefixes not being imported from file

## [0.8.4] - 2025-07-20

**NOTE:** The changes listed here are a catch-all between this version and all prior releases. We haven't kept a good changelog until today, so we apologize for the broad statements to keep this document section brief.

### Added

- application CLI
- support for converting directly to `.ttl` files from draw.io and vice versa
- support for literals and literal annotations (language and datatype)
- term matching via reference ontologies
- ability to add reference ontologies
- unique literal ID generation option
- support for annotation types
- classes-only option for drawing layouts
- ability to write prefixes
- tree-splitting for dealing with multiple inheritance
- stratified term category (includes definitions, annotations, etc.) for prioritizing in the layout
- match suppression with star keys
- alias support with parenthetic notation
- README instructions on CLI and scripting for new package implementation

### Changed

- programmming paradigm, from an clunky OOP-based approach to a hybrid functional approach
- File structure, adopting file conventions in functional programming
- all prior functionality implementations except those expressly mentioned in the remove section
- choosing more general category of terms to draw in the tree layout (stratified) versus just rank terms (subclass and type)
- shape definitions from native classes to dataclasses
- rendering shapes directly from dataclasses instead of through manual prop generation
- computing arrow directions dynamically based on shape angle instead of static case-based matching
- example scripts

### Removed

- All functions built under the OOP-based software
- shape-extent-based area diagram reading
- circle-based (organic) layouts
- straight-arrow and curve template files
- error detection in diagram reads
- defer-layout option
